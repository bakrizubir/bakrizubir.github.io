# Engineering Tools & Applications

I've developed a suite of well engineering calculation tools that solve real operational challenges. Originally built as Excel templates used across multiple drilling campaigns, I'm now transforming these into accessible web applications for the global energy community.

## 🛠️ Tools Portfolio

### 1. **Kick Tolerance Calculator**
Calculates safe drilling margins and kick tolerance for well control scenarios. Critical for preventing blowouts and ensuring safe drilling operations in high-pressure environments.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 2. **MD-TVD Depth Converter**
Converts measured depth to true vertical depth for directional and horizontal wells. Essential for accurate well planning, survey calculations, and geological correlation.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 3. **Well Stick Count Visualization**
Visual tool for planning and tracking tubular inventory (drill pipe, casing, tubing). Optimizes logistics and prevents costly equipment shortages during operations.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 4. **MAASP Calculator**
Calculates Maximum Allowable Annular Surface Pressure to prevent formation breakdown and casing failure. Critical safety tool for drilling and well intervention operations.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 5. **Well Envelope Calculator**
Determines safe operational limits for drilling, completion, and production. Integrates pore pressure, fracture gradient, and wellbore stability analysis.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 6. **Management of Change (MOC) Framework**
Structured documentation system for tracking operational changes, risk assessment, and approval workflows. Ensures safety and regulatory compliance.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 7. **Incident Investigation Framework**
Systematic approach to incident analysis, root cause identification, and corrective action tracking. Drives continuous safety improvement.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 8. **Contractor Equipment Troubleshooting Framework**
Diagnostic tool for identifying and resolving drilling equipment issues. Reduces non-productive time and improves operational efficiency.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 9. **Gas Project Economics Analyzer**
Financial modeling tool for gas development projects. Calculates NPV, IRR, breakeven prices, and development scenarios for investment decisions.

*Status: Web app in development*

---

### 10. **Well Cost Estimator**
Comprehensive AFE (Authorization for Expenditure) tool that estimates total well costs including drilling, completion, and contingencies. Used across multiple $10M+ well programs.

*Status: Web app in development*

## Vision

These tools represent 16+ years of field experience distilled into practical applications. My goal is to make advanced well engineering calculations accessible to the global energy community—helping engineers make better decisions, faster.

**Future plans:**
- Free basic versions for industry professionals
- Premium features for advanced analysis
- Mobile-responsive design for field use
- API access for integration with existing workflows

---

## Technical Validation

All tools have been field-tested across multiple drilling campaigns with **EOG Resources**, **Bapco**, **Hess Corporation**, **EnQuest**, and **Petronas** in challenging environments including:
- HPHT gas wells
- Extended reach drilling offshore operations
- Deepwater exploration
- Total losses environments
- Geothermal applications
