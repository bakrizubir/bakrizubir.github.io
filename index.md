## About Me

I'm a project management leader and senior engineer with over 16 years of experience driving asset development and capital projects across IOC, NOC, and Fortune 500 energy companies. I specialize in bridging complex subsurface engineering with large-scale capital projects, managing portfolios up to $250M throughout the full project lifecycle.

My career spans leadership roles at **EOG Resources**, **Bapco Upstream**, **Carigali Hess-Corporation**, **EnQuest PLC**, and **Petronas** across the Middle East and South East Asia. I've consistently delivered exceptional results: reducing well costs by 50%, accelerating project timelines, and driving operational efficiency improvements of 20-110%.

As a Chartered Engineer with an MSc in Petroleum Engineering from Heriot-Watt University, I combine deep technical expertise with strategic vision for the future of energy—particularly in gas development, CCUS, and digital transformation of traditional drilling operations.

## What I'm Building

I'm developing a suite of **web-based engineering tools** to modernize well engineering workflows. These tools, originally built as Excel templates, are being transformed into accessible web applications for the global energy community:
